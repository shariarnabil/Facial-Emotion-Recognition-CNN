# Facial-Emotion-Recognition-CNN
  
A deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for detecting and classifying human facial emotions using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.

## üìå Project Overview
Human emotions are a fundamental aspect of non-verbal communication. This project leverages deep learning to recognize emotions from facial expressions.  
The model is trained on facial images and classifies them into categories such as **happy, sad, angry, surprise, neutral, fear, and disgust**.

## üöÄ Features
- End-to-end emotion recognition using CNNs
- Trained on labeled facial image datasets
- Real-time emotion detection support
- Built with Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and OpenCV
- Extensible for real-world applications (healthcare, HCI, surveillance, etc.)
